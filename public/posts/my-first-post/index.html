<p>It really didn&rsquo;t matter what they did to him. He&rsquo;s already made up his mind. Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it.</p>
<p>It had been a late night. To be more correct, it had been an early morning. It was now 3:00 AM and George was just getting home. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it had been worth it. He was supposed to have been finished by 10:00 PM, but his boss had implored him to stay and help when it was clear they weren&rsquo;t going to meet the 10:00 PM target time. So, he had stayed an extra 5 hours and lost a good night&rsquo;s sleep for something he didn&rsquo;t really believe in, but he did anyway because he was afraid if he refused he might lose his job.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s simply better to ignore the haters. That&rsquo;s the lesson that Tom&rsquo;s dad had been trying to teach him, but Tom still couldn&rsquo;t let it go. He latched onto them and their hate and couldn&rsquo;t let it go, but he also realized that this wasn&rsquo;t healthy. That&rsquo;s when he came up with his devious plan.</p>
<p>He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement.</p>
