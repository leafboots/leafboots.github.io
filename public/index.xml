He latched onto them and their hate and couldn&amp;rsquo;t let it go, but he also realized that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t healthy. That&amp;rsquo;s when he came up with his devious planed.

Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it.
It had been a late night. To be more correct, it had been an early morning.

          Hi there # My name is Radek and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.
